It was quite hard honestly speaking to make this project but i had got a taste of javascript by creating some project so i was able to make this one with some more fun. 

The biggest challenge was managing multiple timers simultaneously - coordinating the countdown, question timer, and visual timer bar while preventing race conditions and duplicate function calls. I learned to use flags to prevent bugs when timers would fire multiple times. Managing game state without a framework was also tricky - tracking unlocked genres, completed movies, scores, and lives across different screens while keeping everything synchronized. 

I also struggled with event listener memory leaks until I learned the replaceWith(cloneNode()) pattern to clean them up, and implementing the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for randomizing questions taught me proper array shuffling beyond just using Math.random().

Took helped from friends, used a little bit of ai, learned and coded a lot.
